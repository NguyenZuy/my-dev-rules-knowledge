- IP addresses:
	- **Definition:** IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are unique numerical labels assigned to devices connected to a network. They are used for identification and location addressing in networks.
	- **Types:**
	    - **IPv4:** A 32-bit address, written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
	    - **IPv6:** A 128-bit address, written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- MAC addresses:
		- **Definition:** A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface card (NIC) of a device. It is used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure devices can communicate within a local network.
	- **Format:** Typically 48 bits long, displayed as six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).

| Change                          | Not change (unless manual) |

- Subnetting:
	- **Definition:** Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). It helps optimize network performance, improve security, and efficiently use IP address space.
	- **Purpose:** Reduces network traffic and allows better organization of network resources.
	- **How it works:** It involves the use of subnet masks, which indicate which part of the IP address refers to the network and which part refers to the host.
- LAN, WAN and MAN:

| LAN (Local Area Network)                                                                                  | WAN (Wide Area Network)                                                                                                    | MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)                                                         |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A network of computers and devices within a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building. | A large-scale network that spans a broad geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs. The internet is the largest WAN. | A network that covers a city or large campus, larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. |
| Typically uses Ethernet or Wi-Fi technology.                                                              | Uses leased lines, fiber optics, or satellite links for long-distance communication.                                       | Often used by businesses or local government entities to connect various buildings.     |
