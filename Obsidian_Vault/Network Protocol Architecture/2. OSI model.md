- Open Systems Interconnection
- Is a conceptual framework in network protocol architecture that standardizes the functions of the telecommunication or computing systems into 7 distinct layers.

| Order | Layer        | Role                                                                                                                              | Example             |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | Physical     | Handles connection between devices (including cables, switches, etc.) and transmission of raw binary data over these connections. | NFC, Bluetooth      |
| 2     | Data Link    | Manage transfer data where is already have physical connection, dealing - detect errors                                           | Ethernet            |
| 3     | Network      | Responsible for routing data between devices across multiple networks and manages addresssing (IP, etc.) -> determine data path   | IPv4, IPv6          |
| 4     | Transport    | Ensures reliable data transfer with error-checking, data flow control and retransmission if needed                                | TCP, UDP            |
| 5     | Session      | Manages session or connections between applications, handling setup, management and termination of these session                  | NFS, SMB            |
| 6     | Presentation | Transform data into a format understandable by the application layer. It Manages data encode, encryption and compression.         | HTML, JSON, CSV     |
| 7     | Application  | Top layer, directly inter with end-users, provice network service to application                                                  | HTTP, FTP, SMTP,etc |
