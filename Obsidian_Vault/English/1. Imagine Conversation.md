### Interview at ABC company for Unity Game Developer position

**Interviewer:** Good morning, thanks for coming in today. Welcome to our company's interview for the Unity Game Developer position.

**Candidate:** Good morning. Thank you for having me.

**Interviewer:** Let's start with a quick introduction. Can you tell me a little about yourself and your experience in game development?

**Candidate:** Certainly. My name is Duy Hoang Nguyen, and I graduated from the Post and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT). I have about three years of experience in game development, specifically as a Unity Developer.

**Interviewer:** Great, thanks for the information. Another question: Why did you choose our company?

**Candidate:** I am looking for a new environment where I can improve my skills and knowledge. Additionally, I am seeking a position with a higher salary. I believe ABC Company is a good fit for me because of its reputation and the opportunities it offers for growth.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for your reply. Now, let's move on to the technical test. Let me introduce Lam, our company's Tech Lead. He has over 10 years of experience in the field.

**Tech Lead:** Good morning, nice to meet you.

**Candidate:** Good morning, nice to meet you too.

**Tech Lead:** Hmm, let me take a look at your resume. You mentioned that you are a full-stack game developer, meaning you can handle both client and server-side development, right?

**Candidate:** Yes, I can manage the entire lifecycle of a multiplayer game.

**Tech Lead:** Good. So, can you tell me how clients communicate with each other in a multiplayer game?

**Candidate:** In a client-server architecture, clients send messages to the server using various protocols like HTTP, Socket, or WebSocket over the internet. The server then relays these messages to the other clients.

**Tech Lead:** Why don't we just have clients send messages directly to each other?

**Candidate:** Typically, clients are individual devices like computers or mobile phones that don't have public (static) IP addresses. They also don't open ports for security reasons, which makes direct communication between them difficult.

**Tech Lead:** Good point. Another question: Imagine you have a project targeting mobile devices, but when you publish it, the game is very laggy and disappoints players. How would you fix this?

**Candidate:** In such a situation, I would first identify the root cause of the problem. It could be due to heavy shaders, inefficient scripts, excessive work in the Update method, or runtime errors. Once I identify the issues, I would apply appropriate solutions. For example, I might use Unity's graphics performance solutions like Draw Mesh Instancing or GPU instancing. If the issue is related to script functionality, I would consider using UniTask for multithreading or Unity DOTS for better performance.

**Tech Lead:** Absolutely. Have you used Unity DOTS before?

**Candidate:** Yes, in my previous company, I had a task that required the use of Unity DOTS. I developed a traffic system with over a thousand cars and pedestrians. Traditional C# couldn't handle it efficiently, so I implemented it using Unity DOTS, and it performed well even on mobile devices.

**Tech Lead:** That's impressive. You have a good knowledge base. I hope to work with you.

**Candidate:** Thank you.

**Interviewer:** So, what is your expected salary if you join us?

**Candidate:** Based on the job description, I am confident that I can meet about 90% of the requirements. The salary range mentioned in the JD is 10-25 million VND, so my expected salary is around 22 million VND.

**Interviewer:** Okay, thank you. We hope to work with you too.

**Candidate:** Thank you for the interview.
