### Definition
- A `record` is a reference type that was introduced in C# 9.0. Records are designed to make creating immutable data objects simpler. Unlike classes, which are used for representing entities with behavior, records are intended to represent data models or objects with value-based equality rather than reference-based equality.
- Key features:
	- Immutable by Default: useful for create immutable objects -> meaning that once created, the data cannot be changed. Howeve, you can create multable records if need.
	- Value-Base Equality: the equality of records is based on their values rather than their references -> two records instances are considered equal if their properties have the same values.
	- Concise Synatax
### Use Cases
- `Data Models`: are ideal for defining simple data models such as player info, game setting or config data.
- `Immutable Game Settings`: for game setting that should not change during gameplay.
- `Value Objects in Game Logic`: vectors, colors or inventory items, etc
- `Scriptable Object Replacement`: can use for data that does not need to be serialized or stored in Unity Editor

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Records to Replace ScriptableObject

| Aspect                    | Advantage of Using Records                                                                                         | Disadvantage of Using Records                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Immutability              | Records are immutable by default, reducing the risk of data being unintentionally modified during gameplay.        | Immutability may limit flexibility if you need to update data frequently at runtime.                                                         |
| Simplicity                | Concise syntax makes defining simple data models cleaner and easier to read.                                       | Lacks the built-in support and features provided by ScriptableObjects, such as Inspector visibility.                                         |
| Value-Based Equality      | Useful for comparing data objects based on their values, which can simplify logic in certain cases.                | Value-based equality may be unnecessary for scenarios where reference equality is more appropriate.                                          |
| Performance               | Records provide a simple and efficient way to store data without the overhead of behavior or reference management. | Performance can be less efficient compared to structs for frequently used, small data structures.                                            |
| Serialization             | Records do not require the overhead of Unity’s serialization system, which can simplify data models.               | Records cannot be serialized and displayed in the Unity Inspector, making them less useful for data that needs to be adjusted in the Editor. |
| Memory Management         | Automatically handled as a reference type, making them easy to manage without worrying about the stack.            | Being allocated on the heap may increase memory pressure compared to lightweight structs.                                                    |
| ScriptableObject Features | Avoids the need for asset management and scriptable data creation in the Editor.                                   | Lacks built-in support for Unity-specific features like ScriptableObject lifecycle events (`OnEnable`, `OnDisable`).                         |
| Flexibility               | Great for storing fixed configuration data that doesn’t change, like default player settings.                      | Less flexible for data that needs to be customized or changed frequently in the Unity Editor.                                                |

| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type                   | Reference Type                                           | Reference Type                                           | Value Type                                                  |
| Immutability           | Immutable by default, but can be made mutable            | Mutable by default                                       | Mutable by default                                          |
| Equality               | Value-based equality (compares values of properties)     | Reference-based equality (compares object references)    | Value-based equality (compares values of fields/properties) |
| Memory Allocation      | Allocated on the heap                                    | Allocated on the heap                                    | Allocated on the stack (if not boxed)                       |
| Performance            | Good for data objects that don’t change frequently       | Suitable for complex objects or when behavior is needed  | Efficient for small data structures used frequently         |
| Use Case               | Data models, immutable settings, configuration objects   | Entities with behavior, complex game objects             | Lightweight data structures, performance-critical code      |
| Concise Syntax         | More concise syntax for defining data models             | More verbose, requires explicit property and constructor | Requires explicit definition of fields and constructors     |
| Inheritance            | Supports inheritance and can derive from classes/records | Supports inheritance and can derive from classes/objects | Does not support inheritance                                |
| Suitability in Unity   | Great for immutable data and configuration settings      | Ideal for game objects with complex behavior and logic   | Best for lightweight data used frequently, like positions   |
| Serialization in Unity | Not supported by Unity’s built-in serialization system   | Fully supported by Unity’s serialization system          | Fully supported by Unity’s serialization system             |

### Example
```
// A simple record for storing player data
public record PlayerData(string Name, int Score);

public class RecordExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Creating instances of the record
        var player1 = new PlayerData("Alice", 100);
        var player2 = new PlayerData("Alice", 100);
        var player3 = new PlayerData("Bob", 150);

        // Value-based equality check
        Debug.Log(player1 == player2); // True, because values are the same
        Debug.Log(player1 == player3); // False, because values are different

        // Immutability demonstration
        // player1.Name = "Charlie"; // Error: properties are read-only by default
    }
}
```

```
// Mutable Records
public record PlayerData
{
    public string Name { get; set; } // Mutable property
    public int Score { get; set; }   // Mutable property
}

public class MutableRecordExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Creating a mutable record instance
        var player = new PlayerData { Name = "Alice", Score = 100 };

        // Modifying the values
        player.Name = "Bob";
        player.Score = 150;

        Debug.Log($"Player: {player.Name}, Score: {player.Score}"); // Output: Player: Bob, Score: 150
    }
}
```
