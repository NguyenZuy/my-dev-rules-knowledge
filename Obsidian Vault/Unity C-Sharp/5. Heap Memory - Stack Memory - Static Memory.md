| Definition        | Memory used for dynamically allocated objects and data.                        | Memory used for storing local variables and function call information.                 | Memory reserved for static variables that persist for the lifetime of the application.                         |
| Allocation        | Objects are allocated on the heap when using `new`.                            | Memory is allocated and deallocated automatically as functions are called and return.  | Allocated at the start of the application and persists until the application ends.                             |
| Deallocation      | Managed by Garbage Collector (automatic but can cause performance issues).     | Automatically deallocated when the function call ends.                                 | Memory is not reclaimed until the application is closed.                                                       |
| Performance       | Slower allocation and access compared to stack memory.                         | Fast allocation and access, as it follows a simple Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. | Access speed is generally fast, but memory use is fixed and can lead to high memory usage if not managed well. |
| Use Cases         | Large objects, objects that need to persist beyond the current function scope. | Local variables, function parameters, temporary data.                                  | Static data, global settings, configuration values.                                                            |
| Scope             | Objects remain in memory until garbage collected.                              | Data is only accessible within the function where it is defined.                       | Available globally throughout the application.                                                                 |
| Memory Management | Developer has less control; relies on the Garbage Collector.<br>               | Fully automatic and very efficient.                                                    | Memory is pre-allocated and persists, requiring careful management to avoid excess usage.                      |

Example:
```
GameObject obj = new GameObject(); // Allocated on the heap

int num = 10; // Allocated on the stack

static int counter = 0; // Allocated in static memory
const int MAX_PLAYERS = 10; // Also Allocated in static memory

// struct
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}
void Example()
{
    Point point = new Point(); // Allocated on the stack
    object boxedPoint = point; // Boxing occurs, allocated on the heap
}

```
