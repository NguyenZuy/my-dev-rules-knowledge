| Definition            | A blueprint for creating objects, which can include fields, properties, methods, and events.               | A class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). | A contract that defines a set of methods and properties that a class must implement. No implementation is provided. |
| Instantiation         | Can be instantiated                                                                                        | Cannot be instantiated directly.                                                                                                               | Cannot be instantiated.                                                                                             |
| Method Implementation | Can contain methods with implementation.                                                                   | Can have both abstract methods (no implementation) and methods with implementation.                                                            | Cannot have method implementations (only method signatures).                                                        |
| Access Modifiers      | Can use access modifiers (public, private, etc.) for methods and properties.                               | Can use access modifiers for methods and properties.                                                                                           | All methods are implicitly public. Access modifiers are not allowed.                                                |
| Inheritance           | Supports single inheritance (can inherit from one base class) but can implement multiple interfaces.       | Supports single inheritance but can implement multiple interfaces.                                                                             | Can inherit from multiple interfaces.                                                                               |

| Constructors          | Can have constructors.                                                                                     | Can have constructors (for initializing data members).                                                                                         | Cannot have constructors.                                                                                           |
| Use Case              | Used when you want to create an object and use object-oriented features like inheritance and polymorphism. | Used when you want to provide some base functionality and force derived classes to implement certain methods.                                  | Used when you want to define a contract that other classes must follow.                                             |
### Fields - Variables

| Feature          | Fields                                                                                                                                                               | Variables                                                                                                                                           |

| Definition       | Fields are variables that are declared at the class or struct level, directly within a class or struct                                                               | Variables are general storage containers for data that are defined within a method, property, constructor, or other block of code                   |
| Scope            | They are part of the class or struct's state and can be used to store data specific to an instance (instance fields) or shared across all instances (static fields). | Variables are only accessible within the block of code in which they are declared. They are local to that block and do not persist beyond its scope |
| Access Modifiers | Fields can have access modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected`, etc., which control their accessibility from outside the class                               | Variables do not use access modifiers because their scope is limited to the block in which they are declared.                                       |
| Usage            | Fields are generally used to store the data that defines the properties or state of an object                                                                        | Variables are used for temporary storage and calculations within a method or block of code.                                                         |

Example: 
```
public class Person
{
    // Fields
    private string name;
    public int age;
}
```

```
public void DisplayAge()
{
    // Variable
    int years = 25; // Local variable
    Console.WriteLine(years);
}
```
