- `t:` stands for "type" .It allows you to search for Assets or GameObjects based on their specific type or component name.
- `l:` **(Search by Label):** You can assign labels to assets in the Inspector. This prefix allows you to find all assets with a specific label.
- `ref:` **(Search by Reference):** This is a very powerful tool. It finds all assets that _reference_ a specific asset.
	- **Example:** `ref:MyPlayerMaterial` will show you every model, prefab, or other asset that uses the "MyPlayerMaterial" material. This is fantastic for tracking down where an asset is being used before you modify or delete it.
- `p:` **(Search by Saved Search Filter):** In the Project window's search bar, there's a small bookmark icon. You can save complex searches and recall them with the `p:` prefix.
	- **Example:** If you save a search for "All Character Models", you might call it `p:CharacterModels`.
