- Transmission Control Protocol - Internet Protocol
- The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework used to understand network communications within computer networks, specifically the internet. It organizes network functions into four layers, each with distinct responsibilities.

| Order | Layer          | Role                                                                                       | Example          |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1     | Network Access | Responsible for physical connections and move raw binary data over network links(Ethernet) | ARP              |
| 2     | Internet       | Routing, handles data packet, IP Address                                                   | IP, ICMP, IGMP   |
| 4     | Transport      | Ensure reliable data transmission between host-to-host                                     | TCP, UDP         |
| 3     | Application    | Top layer, provides protocols for specific data communications across the network.         | HTTPS, FTP, SMTP |
