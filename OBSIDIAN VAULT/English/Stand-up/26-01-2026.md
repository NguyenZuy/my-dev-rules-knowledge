## Original
Today, i will focus on flatbuffer task, i will spend 1 day for develop logic and test all cases. Ensure this function ready to release to users withouts error.
There are all cases i will confirm before release,  first i will testing when user play app without internet. Second i will confirm when the remote flatbuffer data error, the app will use cached or local flatbuffer, will not crash at all.

💡 Grammar & Usage Tips

To sound more like a "Global Developer," focus on these specific areas from your original text:
1. Verbs following "Spend time"

    Original: "...spend 1 day for develop..."

    Correction: "...spend 1 day developing..."

    The Rule: After the verb spend (time/money), we use the -ing form (Gerund).

        Example: "I spent three hours debugging the shader."

2. "Without" vs. "Withouts"

    Original: "...withouts error."

    Correction: "...without errors" or "error-free."

    The Rule: "Without" is a preposition and never takes an "s." To make it sound professional, use the plural "errors" or the compound adjective "error-free."

3. Future Continuous vs. Simple Future

    Original: "...i will testing..."

    Correction: "I will be testing" or "I will test."

    The Rule: You cannot follow "will" directly with an "-ing" verb. You need the helper verb "be."

        Pro-tip: In stand-ups, using "I will focus on..." or "I am prioritizing..." sounds more proactive than just "I will."

4. Technical Phrasing: "Fallback"

    Original: "...the app will use cached or local flatbuffer..."

    Refinement: "...the app will fall back to cached data..."

    Why: In global dev teams, "fallback" is the standard term for a backup plan when a primary system (like remote data) fails. It shows you are thinking about system resilience.

Today, I will focus on FlatBuffer task. I will spend entire day developing logic and testing all cases to ensure this function ready to release for users without errors.
There are all test cases. Firstly, I will test when users play app without the internet. Secondly, I will confirm when the remote FlatBuffer data is error, the app will use cache or local data instead, the app will never crash
