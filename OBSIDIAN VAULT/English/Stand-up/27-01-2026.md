## Original
- I was finished the flatbuffer yesterday. Today, i will spend 4 hours for debugging bugs on sentry. After that i will support education team for tools.
## Feedbacks
- **"I was finished" → "I finished"**
    
    - In English, "I was finished" sounds like you are a project that someone else completed. For things you do yourself, just say **"I finished"** or **"I'm done with."**
        
- **"Spend for" → "Spend on" or "Spend [verb]-ing"**
    
    - You don't spend time _for_ debugging; you **spend time debugging** or **spend time on bugs**.
        
- **"Education team for tools" → "Ed team with tooling"**
    
    - "Tooling" is the professional industry term for the collection of tools devs build for others. Also, "support [someone] **with** [something]" is the correct preposition.
        
- **Capitalization:**
    
    - **FlatBuffer** and **Sentry** are brand names/specific technologies. Capitalizing them makes you look more detail-oriented.
## Improved
> "Yesterday, I **finished up** with FlatBuffer. Today, I'm going to **dive into** Sentry for about four hours to **clear out** some bugs. After that, I’ll be **helping out** the Ed team with their tools."
