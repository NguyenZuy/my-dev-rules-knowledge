## Original
- Hi I'm Duy, I will schedule my today's tasks. Firstly, I will finished up the Sight Reading feature following yesterdays feedbacks. After that, I will update localizations for Theory Music feature. And then I will research and find the English tutor and publish my game to Game Distribution.
## Feedback
- **Tense Consistency:** You used "will finished." After "will," you should always use the base form of the verb: **"will finish."**
    
- **Plurals:** "Feedback" is usually an uncountable noun in English. Instead of "feedbacks," we just say **"feedback."**
    
- **Natural Flow:** Saying "I will schedule my today's tasks" is a bit stiff. Native speakers usually say **"I'm planning my tasks for today"** or **"Here is my to-do list."**
    
- **Articles:** When you say "find **the** English tutor," it sounds like you are looking for one specific person you already know. If you are starting a fresh search, use **"an English tutor."**
