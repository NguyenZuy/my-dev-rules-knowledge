## Original

- Today, I'll finish up the Quiz Task, then I'll check sentry bugs, the last task today is schedule the timeline to convert all module from Mussica to Smulie

## Feedback
- **Articles:** You should use "the" before "Sentry bugs" if you are referring to a specific set of known issues.
    
- **Pluralization:** In the final clause, "module" should be plural (**modules**) since you are converting more than one.
    
- **Verb Tense/Form:** "Schedule the timeline" is okay, but in a professional setting, we usually say "create," "set," or "map out" a timeline.
    
- **Prepositions:** Instead of "schedule the timeline to convert," it sounds more natural to say "schedule the timeline **for converting**" or "create a timeline **to convert**."

## Improved Version
- Today, I'll finish up the Quiz Task, then I'll check the Sentry bugs, the last task today is create a timeline to convert  all modules from Musica to Smulie
