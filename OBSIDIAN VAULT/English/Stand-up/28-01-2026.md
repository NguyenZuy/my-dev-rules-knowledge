## Original
- Today I will trace the bug from Sentry related to my FlatBuffer function and then i will follow to deploy seasonal website. The last task is develop full the SightReading.
## Feedbacks
- **"Trace the bug from Sentry":** While "trace" is okay, **"investigate"** or **"debug"** is more common in a professional dev context.
    
- **"Follow to deploy":** This is a bit clunky. It is more natural to say **"move on to"** or simply **"then deploy."**
    
- **"Seasonal website":** Usually, we say **"the seasonal website"** (adding the article "the").
    
- **"Develop full the SightReading":** This is the main grammatical error. It should be **"finish developing,"** **"complete,"** or **"fully develop"** followed by the object. Also, if "SightReading" is a specific feature or app, it usually needs "the" before it.
## Improved
-Today, I'll investigate a Sentry bug related to my **FlatBuffer function** and then deploy the seasonal website. My final task is **finishing up** the SightReading feature.
