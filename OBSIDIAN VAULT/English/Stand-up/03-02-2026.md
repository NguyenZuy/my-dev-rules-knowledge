## Original
- Hi everyone. Yesterday, I supported Hung to module the rhythm gameplays to 3 separate gameplay and supported Y Lu to convert the React project to React Native project.
- Today I'll be focusing on to module remain gameplays, and then I will start my new Game.

## Feedback
- **The Verb "Module":** In software development, we usually use **modularize** (to turn something into modules) or **break down** (to separate into smaller parts). "Module" is typically a noun, not a verb.
    
- **Word Choice:** Instead of "supported [Name] to," use **"helped [Name] with"** or **"assisted [Name] in."** It flows a bit better in a stand-up or status report.
    
- **Prepositions:** You don't need "to" after "focusing on." It should be "focusing on [task]."
    
- **Grammar:** "Remain gameplays" should be **"the remaining gameplay modes"** or **"the rest of the gameplay."**

## Improved Version
- Hi everyone. Yesterday, I helped Hung modularize the rhythm gameplays to 3 separate gameplay and helped Y Lu to convert the React project to React Native project.
- Today I'll be focusing on  modularize the remaining gameplaý, and then I will start my new Game.

## Recommended Version
"Hi everyone. **Yesterday**, I assisted Hung in modularizing the rhythm mechanics into three separate gameplays. I also supported Y Lu in migrating the project from React to React Native.

**Today**, I’ll be focusing on modularizing the remaining gameplay logic. Once that’s done, I’ll begin setting up the architecture for the new game project. I have no blockers at the moment."
