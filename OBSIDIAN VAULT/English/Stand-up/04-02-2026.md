## Original
- Hi everyone. Yesterday I have finished 2 gameplays from Sight Reading. Today I'll continue 3 gameplays, but firstly I have a blocker in here, the system architecture work well, but when we want to maintain the gameplay, change mechanic, update UI, et cetera we must update 2 times for 2 platform Web and Mobile. Double work, spend more time and less performance. So We need a solution for it. I suggest to update the system architecture to cross-platform, I mean we will change the Tech-stack from NextJS to React Native Web for Web Platform. Keep current for Mobile. Our workflow will change from NextJS development, convert to React Native to write once in React Native, run everywhere. We will save the time, develop faster and easy sync between platforms. We also need redesign the develop principles, no mono-system in here, we need to module the current system gameplay into multiples separate parts, we can paste these modules in web or mobile still working well. That's all, thank you.

## Feedback

- **Tense Consistency:** You used "Yesterday I have finished." Since the action happened at a specific time in the past, use the **simple past**: _"Yesterday, I finished."_
    
- **Vocabulary:**
    
    - **"2 gameplays":** In a dev context, we usually say _"two levels," "two modules,"_ or _"two gameplay features."_
        
    - **"Blocker in here":** Simply say _"I’ve hit a blocker"_ or _"There is a blocker."_
        
    - **"Double work":** A more natural phrase is _"redundant work"_ or _"doubling the effort."_
        
- **Phrasing:**
    
	    - Instead of "less performance," use **"lower efficiency"** (performance usually refers to the software's speed, while efficiency refers to the team's output).
        
    - Instead of "no mono-system," use **"moving away from a monolithic architecture"** or **"decoupling the system."**
        
    - Instead of "paste these modules," use **"integrate"** or **"deploy."**

"Hi everyone. Yesterday, I finished two gameplay modules for Sight Reading. Today, I’m moving on to the next three, but I’ve hit a blocker.

Currently, our architecture works, but maintenance is a hassle. Whenever we update mechanics or the UI, we have to do it twice—once for Web and once for Mobile. This redundant work is time-consuming and inefficient.

To solve this, I suggest moving to a cross-platform architecture. Specifically, I propose switching our Web tech stack from NextJS to React Native Web. By standardizing on React Native, we can 'write once and run everywhere.' This will save us significant time, speed up development, and ensure both platforms stay perfectly in sync.

We’ll also need to redesign our development principles. We should move away from a monolithic system and modularize the gameplay features. This way, we can easily plug these modules into either platform. That’s all from me, thanks!"
