| Feature               | PostgreSQL                                                                                                     | CockroachDB                                                                                                                 | MySQL | MongoDB |

| Purpose               | Traditional, feature-rich relational database for single-node or primary-replica deployments.                  | Distributed SQL database designed for horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, and high availability.                           |       |         |
| Architecture          | Single-node architecture (with optional replication and clustering).                                           | Distributed architecture with automatic replication and sharding.                                                           |       |         |
| Scalability           | Vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single node). Clustering requires manual setup.                   | Horizontal scaling (adding more nodes to the cluster), built-in sharding and replication.                                   |       |         |
| Data Model            | Relational database management system (RDBMS).                                                                 | Relational database management system (RDBMS) with distributed capabilities.                                                |       |         |
| Consistency           | Strong consistency (ACID transactions).                                                                        | Strong consistency (ACID transactions) across distributed nodes using Raft consensus.                                       |       |         |
| High Availability     | Requires manual configuration for high availability (e.g., replication with failover mechanisms like Patroni). | Built-in high availability with automatic failover between nodes.                                                           |       |         |
| Fault Tolerance       | Limited fault tolerance (manual setup required for replication and failover).                                  | Built-in fault tolerance with automatic rebalancing and recovery.                                                           |       |         |
| Replication           | Logical and physical replication (synchronous or asynchronous).                                                | Automatic replication with synchronous consistency using Raft protocol.                                                     |       |         |
| Sharding              | Requires manual sharding and partitioning setup.                                                               | Automatic sharding and data distribution.                                                                                   |       |         |
| Performance           | Optimized for single-node or primary-replica setups; high performance for single-node workloads.               | Designed for distributed workloads; may introduce some latency due to consensus protocols.                                  |       |         |
| SQL Support           | Full SQL compliance, including complex queries, stored procedures, and extensions like PL/pgSQL.               | High compatibility with PostgreSQL SQL syntax; lacks support for some advanced features like stored procedures.             |       |         |
| Indexes               | Supports B-tree, GIN, GiST, BRIN, and hash indexes.                                                            | Supports B-tree and inverted indexes; fewer index types compared to PostgreSQL.                                             |       |         |
| Concurrency Control   | MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control).                                                                       | MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control) with distributed transaction management.                                            |       |         |
| Use Cases             | - Single-node or primary-replica setups.  <br>- Transactional applications.  <br>- Reporting and analytics.    | - Geo-distributed applications.  <br>- Fault-tolerant and scalable transactional systems.  <br>- Cloud-native applications. |       |         |
| Cloud Integration     | Cloud-native solutions available (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL).             | Fully cloud-native design; CockroachCloud offers managed service.                                                           |       |         |
| Extensions            | Rich ecosystem of extensions (e.g., PostGIS, TimescaleDB, Citus).                                              | Limited extension support compared to PostgreSQL.                                                                           |       |         |
| Backup and Restore    | Native tools like `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, and WAL archiving.                                                  | Native backup and restore with distributed snapshots.                                                                       |       |         |
| Community and Support | Mature and large community, extensive documentation, and commercial support options.                           | Relatively smaller community, but growing rapidly; enterprise and managed support available.                                |       |         |
| License               | Open-source under PostgreSQL license.                                                                          | Open-source core under Apache 2.0; some advanced features require a commercial license.                                     |       |         |
| Setup Complexity      | Easy to set up for single-node; more complex for replication and clustering.                                   | Simplified setup for distributed clusters.                                                                                  |       |         |
| Cost                  | Free and open-source; hosting costs vary depending on infrastructure setup.                                    | Free open-source core; CockroachCloud and advanced features have additional costs.                                          |       |         |
