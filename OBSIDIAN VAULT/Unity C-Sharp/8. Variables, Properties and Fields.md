### Variables
- **Definition**: A variable in C# is a storage location that holds a value of a specific type. Variables are defined inside methods, properties, or constructors.
- **Scope**: The scope of a variable depends on where it is declared (e.g., local variables within a method or global variables within a class).
- **Types**: Variables can be primitive types (like `int`, `bool`, `float`) or complex types (like objects of a class)
- Example:
	``` C#
	int number = 10;  // 'number' is a variable of type int
	string name = "John";  // 'name' is a variable of type string
	```
### Fields
- **Definition**: A field is a variable that is declared directly in a class or struct. Fields can be public, private, protected, or internal, depending on the access level needed.
- **Usage**: Fields are used to store data or state information of an object. Typically, fields are private and accessed through properties to follow best practices.
- Example:
	``` C#
	public class MyClass
	{
	    private int age;  // 'age' is a private field
	    public string name;  // 'name' is a public field
	}
	```

### Properties
- **Definition**: Properties are members of a class that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. They use `get` and `set` accessors.
- **Encapsulation**: Properties help encapsulate the internal representation of a field and provide controlled access to it.
- **Auto-Implemented Properties**: These properties can be declared without explicit backing fields, and the compiler generates the field automatically.
- Example:
	``` C#
	public class MyClass
	{
	    private int _age;  // Backing field for the property

	    public int Age   // Property with get and set accessors
	    {
	        get { return _age; }
		    set { _age = value; }
	    }

	    // Auto-implemented property
	    public string Name { get; set; }
	}
	```
