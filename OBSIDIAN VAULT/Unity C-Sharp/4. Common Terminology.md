### Overhead
- In software development, `overhead` refers to the extra resources (such as time, memory or processing power) required to perform a task or run a system. 
- In Unity, `overhead` could come from features or code that consume more memory or CPU time than necessary, afftecting the game's performance.
- Example: using complex physics calculations where simple ones would suffice, or running unnecessary updates in the `Update()` loop.
### Bottleneck
- Is a part of the system that limits overall performance.
- In Unity, a bottleneck might occur when one part of your game (such as rendering, physics or scripting) takes up so much processing time that is slows down the entire game.
- Example: complex shaders, too many game objects being processed or inefficient code.
