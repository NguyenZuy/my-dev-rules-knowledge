### **The Golden Rule of `async/await`**: 
- Marking a method with `async` does **not** automatically move any of its code to a background thread.
- All `async` does is **enable** the use of the `await` keyword inside that method. It simply changes how the method is compiled, allowing it to be "paused" and "resumed."
- Asynchronous programming is related to multithreading, but it doesn't necessarily require it. The core idea is to start a task without waiting for it to finish - meaning an asynchronous operation can still run on the same thread at different points in time
