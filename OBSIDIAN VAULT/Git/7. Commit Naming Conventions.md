# Commit Naming Conventions

A guide to writing clear, consistent, and meaningful commit messages using the Conventional Commits specification.

## Overview

The Conventional Commits specification provides a lightweight convention for commit messages that makes them human and machine readable. This helps create an explicit commit history and enables automated tools.

## Basic Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

### Required Types

- **feat**: A new feature for the user
  - Correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning
  - Example: `feat: add user authentication`

- **fix**: A bug fix
  - Correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning  
  - Example: `fix: resolve login validation error`

### Additional Types

- **build**: Changes to build system or external dependencies
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks that don't affect source code
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes can be indicated in two ways:

1. **Using `!` after type/scope**: `feat!: remove deprecated API`
2. **Using footer**: 
   ```
   feat: allow config object to extend other configs
   
   BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
   ```

## Scope (Optional)

Provides additional context about the section of codebase affected:

- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration`
- `fix(parser): handle edge case in JSON parsing`
- `docs(api): update authentication examples`

## Examples

### Simple commits
```bash
docs: correct spelling in README
feat(lang): add Polish language support
fix: prevent racing of requests
chore: update dependencies
```

### With body and footer
```bash
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.

### Breaking changes
```bash
feat!: send email notification when product ships

chore!: drop support for Node 6

BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature"
2. **Keep description under 50 characters** for the first line
3. **Capitalize the first letter** of the description
4. **No period at the end** of the description
5. **Be specific and descriptive** about what changed
6. **Use body for complex changes** to explain why and how

## Common Patterns

### Feature Development
```bash
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
feat(auth): integrate OAuth2 providers
```

### Bug Fixes
```bash
fix(auth): resolve token expiration handling
fix(ui): correct button alignment on mobile
fix(api): handle null response from external service
```

### Documentation
```bash
docs: add installation instructions
docs(api): update authentication examples
docs: fix typos in contributing guide
```

### Maintenance
```bash
chore: update npm dependencies
chore(deps): bump lodash from 4.17.19 to 4.17.21
build: update webpack configuration
```

## Revert Commits

For reverting previous commits:

```bash
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident

## Tools and Automation

Conventional commits enable:
- **Automatic CHANGELOG generation**
- **Semantic versioning automation**
- **CI/CD pipeline triggers**
- **Commit message validation**
- **Release note generation**

## Validation

Consider using tools like:
- `commitlint` for commit message validation
- `husky` for git hooks
- `conventional-changelog` for automated changelogs
